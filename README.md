## Property Price Prediction

## Motivation 
A key challenge for property sellers is to determine the sale price of the property. 
The ability to predict the exact property value is beneficial for property investors as well as for buyers to plan their finances according to the price trend. 
The property prices depend on the number of features like the property area, basement square footage, year built, number of bedrooms, and so on.

## Problem statement 
Use regression analysis to predict the price of a property using R.

## Dataset Information 
* Price – Sales price in $000 per acre 
* Size – Size of the property in acres 
* Elevation – Average Elevation in foot above sea level 
* Sewer – Distance (in feet) to nearest sewer connection 
* Days – Date of sale counting backward from current time (in days) 
* Flood – Subject to flooding by tidal action =1; otherwise =0 
* Distance – Distance in miles from city centre
